## Installation

Add the addon to your project via `composer`.

```bash
composer require mattrothenberg/statamic-mapbox-address
```

Make sure to add the following environment variable, since this library uses [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/) under the hood for address autocompletion. The addon **will not work** without a valid key.

```
MAPBOX_API_KEY=""
```

## Configuration

Currently, only a few configuration options are supported, although [Mapbox's forward geocoding API exposes a variety of settings.](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-js/blob/main/docs/services.md#forwardgeocode).

- `placeholder (string>)`: Placeholder text for the rendered picker.
- `countries (Array<string>)`: Limits results to the specified countries. Each item in the array should be an ISO 3166 alpha 2 country code.
- `featureTypes ("country" | "region" | "postcode" | "district" | "place" | "locality" | "neighborhood" | "address" | "poi" | "poi.landmark"):`: Filter results by feature types
- `language (Array<string>)`: Specify the language to use for response text and, for forward geocoding, query result weighting. Options are IETF language tags comprised of a mandatory ISO 639-1 language code and optionally one or more IETF subtags for country or script.

Please feel free to submit a pull request if you'd like to add other settings to the configuration screen.

## Serialization

When selecting an address from the picker, the entire result will be serialized on your entry. The structure of a result is as follows:

```yaml
